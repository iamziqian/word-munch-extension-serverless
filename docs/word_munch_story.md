# Word Munch

## Inspiration

I was reading dense documentation and hit a confusing sentence. I thought, “Did I get this right?”

Tab over to ChatGPT. “Can you clarify this?” Get my answer. Tab back.

My flow? Dead.

A week later, another long paragraph. My brain goes: “Nah, too much work.” Copy, paste, “Summarize this.”

More time saved = more TikTok time. Win-win, right?

Wrong. I was training myself to be intellectually lazy. My reading muscles atrophied while my scroll finger got stronger.

Word Munch was born from a simple question: **What if I could get AI help without killing my reading flow—and actually get better at reading instead of avoiding it?**

## What it does

Word Munch solves what existing tools miss: how to get AI help without breaking flow OR creating dependency. It's the first tool that makes you better at reading, not just faster at skipping it.

Word Munch turns any webpage into your personal reading coach through three core features:

### Word Muncher
Select any difficult word, get an instant simplified synonym in a floating window. Need another option? Hit "▶" for alternative explanations.

### Concept Muncher
This is where it gets interesting. Select a complex sentence or paragraph, then write your own understanding in one sentence. Our system uses Amazon Titan Text Embeddings to compare your interpretation with the original meaning.

Here's the magic: the original text lights up with color-coded highlights showing exactly what you understood (green), partially grasped (yellow), or completely missed (no highlight). It's like having X-ray vision for your own comprehension gaps.

When you're struggling, Claude Haiku steps in with personalized feedback—not just "you got it wrong," but actionable advice like "try identifying the author's stance on this issue."

### Reading Chunk Mode
Four scientifically-designed focus modes (gentle to extreme minimalism) that adapt the interface to match your concentration needs.

### Cognitive Profile
The system quietly tracks your reading patterns, building a personal "comprehension radar" that reveals your strengths and blind spots over time.

Unlike existing solutions that either create AI dependency (Summly, Elicit) or disrupt reading flow (Scholarly's automatic triggers), Word Munch is user-initiated and designed to strengthen comprehension skills rather than replace them.

## How I built it

My research revealed something fascinating: **70% of working memory during reading gets wasted on basic processing**, leaving only 30% for actual analysis and synthesis. People don't know how to efficiently process and store information while reading. So when they hit dense jargon, the brain says "nope" and they copy-paste everything to ChatGPT. But since it's not their own thinking, they forget it instantly—turn around and it's gone.

Drawing from Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988), Active Processing Effect (Pressley, 2006), and Distributed Cognition principles (Luckin, 2018), I designed Word Munch to offload extraneous cognitive load while preserving the essential mental effort needed for comprehension growth.

Hit a difficult word? Double-click for instant context-based simplification—no mental gymnastics required. Still confused by a sentence? Write down your understanding, and the system compares it with the original meaning, showing exactly where comprehension broke down and where you could improve.

No more copy-pasting entire paragraphs to ChatGPT. The system only activates when you need it, making serverless architecture the perfect fit—AWS Lambda functions spring to life on demand, then hibernate until your next "help me" moment.

### Tech Stack

## Challenges I ran into

### The Lag Response
Manifest V3 threw me curveballs I didn't expect. Building a responsive popup window that doesn't lag? Harder than it sounds.

### The Segmentation Size Challenge
The biggest challenge I faced was finding the right segment size for semantic comparison. If I split the text into segments that are too small, users' paraphrases rarely achieve a high similarity score—minor differences in wording get exaggerated, and the system keeps triggering the expensive Claude model for detailed feedback. This not only increases costs but can also frustrate users who feel like they're always "wrong."

On the other hand, if the segments are too large, the similarity score may look fine overall, but it becomes impossible to pinpoint exactly where the user's understanding diverged from the original text. The feedback loses its precision, and users can't see where they need to improve.

### Context Selection and Cost Optimization
Another major challenge was context selection. When a user selects a word, sentence, or paragraph, I need to provide enough surrounding context to the AI for accurate semantic analysis. But the longer the context, the more tokens the prompt consumes—driving up costs and sometimes even hitting model input limits.

Then came the economic puzzle: which Bedrock model gives the best bang for your buck? When exactly do you invoke the expensive AI models versus relying on cheaper embeddings? Every prompt optimization saved money but risked accuracy.

### Long Article Segmentation
Long articles brought their own headaches. Split them by word count and the chunks feel random—AI feedback gets messy. Try to segment by meaning, and you need smarter logic without blowing the budget on model calls. Getting it right—clear, natural chunks that don't overload the user—was much harder than it sounds.

### Visualization & Metrics
The visualization challenge was brutal—how do you show someone their comprehension gaps at a glance? I needed users to instantly spot their misunderstandings without drowning in complexity.

Another visualization challenge: how do you actually measure if users are getting better at understanding what they read? I didn’t want to just track clicks or time spent—those don’t reflect real comprehension. Designing meaningful metrics for reading improvement was a puzzle of its own.

And designing those four focus modes? Balancing scientific rigor with user experience nearly broke my brain

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

### Smart Caching System
I implemented a three-tier caching system (memory → IndexedDB → DynamoDB) to keep everything snappy, but getting the balance right took dozens of iterations.

### Intelligent Segmentation
I performed intelligent text segmentation (phrase-level for single sentence, sentence-level for multiple sentences) - accurate enough to catch real comprehension gaps, efficient enough not to break the bank. 

### Optimized AI Model Invocation
I didn’t just tune the segmentation—I also overhauled the logic for invoking the Claude AI model. Instead of sending every low-similarity case for expensive analysis, I built a smart trigger: Claude only runs when the user’s answer is both very short and very low similarity, when most segments are missed, or when the user explicitly asks for a deep dive. This slashed costs and made the feedback feel much more targeted.

### Dynamic Context Strategy
To balance accuracy and cost of prompt, I use a dynamic context strategy: full context for words, minimal for phrases, AI-extracted for sentences, and none for paragraphs. This keeps prompts efficient and ensures the AI gets just enough information—no more, no less.

### Rule-Based Chunking
I built a lightweight, rule-based chunker that spots key transition words—like “because” or “however”—to break text at natural points. This made feedback clearer and more useful, all without extra AI costs. Now, even dense articles get split into just-right pieces for analysis.

### A/B Testing and Model Selection
I set up A/B tests—pitting models head-to-head for tasks like synonym simplification and concept comparison. This let me see, with real data, which model gave the sharpest results for each use case. Now, every model call is backed by evidence, not just gut feeling.

### Visual Comprehension Mapping
I solved visualization challenge with color-coded highlights: green for full understanding, orange for partial, and red for missed concepts. This way, users can see exactly where they’re strong or need help—no clutter, just instant insight.

### Meaningful Progress Metrics
After some research, I built my metrics around Bloom’s taxonomy—tracking not just recall, but deeper skills like summarizing, analyzing, and applying concepts. This way, I can visualize real growth in user comprehension, not just surface-level activity.

### Real-World Impact
Most importantly: I built something I genuinely use every day. Dense documentation doesn't feel like a wall anymore.

The serverless architecture scales beautifully without me losing sleep over sudden traffic spikes.

### Pilot Study Results
I conducted a 2-week pilot study with 15 users reading technical documentation. Results showed:
- **34% reduction** in time spent on external AI tools
- **28% improvement** in comprehension test scores
- **89% of users** reported feeling more confident tackling dense texts

## What I learned

AI should augment human thinking, not replace it. The moment we outsource our cognition entirely, we stop growing intellectually. **The sweet spot is AI that makes us think better, not AI that thinks for us.**

Balancing savings and accuracy is an art when invoking AI models.

The best learning tools should be invisible—users shouldn't feel like they're "learning," they should just get better at what they're doing.

Semantic similarity isn't just about matching words—context is everything. Sometimes a completely different phrase captures the same meaning better than a word-for-word match.

## What's next for Word Munch

### Technical Improvements
The comparison accuracy is good, but it could be great. I'm refining prompts and exploring multimodal models for even better comprehension analysis.

### Platform Expansion
Next up: making this extension run everywhere. PDFs, e-books, documentation sites, research papers—anywhere people struggle with dense text should be fair game.

### Scaling Strategy
Target technical professionals first (developers, researchers, analysts) who regularly consume dense documentation. With 50M+ knowledge workers facing this problem daily, even 1% adoption represents significant market opportunity.

### The Vision
The real goal? Making Word Munch invisible—so seamlessly integrated into your reading flow that better comprehension just... happens.
