    "Deep learning, which uses neural networks with multiple layers, has achieved breakthrough results in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. The technology mimics the way human brains process information through interconnected neurons.",
    "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with rising global temperatures causing widespread environmental disruption. Scientists warn that immediate action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit further warming.",
    "Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are becoming increasingly cost-effective alternatives to fossil fuels. Many countries are investing heavily in clean energy infrastructure to meet their climate commitments and reduce carbon emissions.",
